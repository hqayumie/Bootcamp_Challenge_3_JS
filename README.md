Password generator challenge
The purpose of this webpage is to create a password generator.The user can click on the geneate password button and a pop up windown will prompt the user to pick a number of characters for their password that must be a minimum of 8 characters and maximum of 128 characters in length. Once the user has selected a password length a series of prompts begin asking the user what character choices they would like included in their password to make it unique.This is done by creating possible chararcter notes below the "generate button in javascript code. Possibl character choices included an array for upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers and special characters. Once the user has completed their choice and gone through the prompts for each special character they would like to include a password will generate using a loop. My code includes javascript fundamentals such as objects, arrays, 'while' and 'if' statements as well as function calls. Some challenges I ran into include my style sheet with css. The code is all there but the styling doesn't get applied to the application. The prompts were working at first but I've run into a glitch with that as well and unfortunately did not give myself enough time to try and debug the errors. This web application is a work in progress, needless to say.
